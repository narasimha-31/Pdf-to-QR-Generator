### ⚠️ Heads-Up About Hosting

This project uses **Supabase’s free tier** to host uploaded PDF files.  
If there’s **no activity for 1 week**, Supabase may temporarily pause the storage.

> If the **QR code doesn’t load** or the **app seems broken**, it’s likely just sleeping 💤  
> Try again later, or star the repo and raise an issue, I’ll manually wake it up 👨‍💻
