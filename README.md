## 🤔 Why I Built This

There are tons of QR code generators out there. I tried a few, and most of them asked for my email just to send me a QR code. Felt like **data theft** in disguise.

So I thought, 'Why not build my own?'

This tool solves a simple but **personally important** problem:  
When I want to share my **resume** quickly, I don’t want to rely on some random app. Instead, I just upload it here and show the QR code on my phone. Boom, people scan it and instantly view my resume. **No signups, no spam.**
